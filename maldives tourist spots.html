            <div class="feature-details"><h4>Banana Reef</h4><p>Many travelers heading to the islands of the Maldives will be coming for one thing and one thing only: diving.

And there’s hardly a single better place to don the SCUBA gear and wetsuits in the country than at the Banana Reef.

This fruit-shaped dash of multi-colored corals and seaweed-clad sandbanks lies underwater between the isles of the North Male Atoll.

It’s served by countless outfitters, who lead excursions to uncover the striped snappers and bulbous sponges, the reef sharks and the barracudas that all coalesce here.</p></div>

            <div class="feature-details"><h4>Fuvahmulah</h4><p>Fuvahmulah promises something a little different to the rest of the Maldivian atolls.

For starters, this speck on the map of the Indian Ocean doesn’t really have any near neighbors, and it occupies an atoll all of its own.

It’s also peppered with the occasional inland lake, which is a rare sight to see in this flat-lying country.

Meanwhile the sandbanks that ring popular Banging Beach make for some crashing rollers and refreshing salt-spray (a break from the usual relaxing lapping lagoons), and the proximity to the Earth’s equator means steamy weather throughout the year. </p></div>

            <div class="feature-details"><h4>Male</h4><p> Thrumming with scooters and cars and Indian bazaars stacked with coconuts and spice, the city of Male – the capital of the Maldives atolls – has the frenetic feel of a place crammed into a slot that’s too small for it.

And that’s because it is.

Although rarely visited (most travelers bypass the city on seaplanes heading straight for their resort), the town is crammed onto a pint-sized islet in the North Male Atoll.

It manages to fit some fascinating sights between its streets though, like the 17th-century Friday Mosque and the gold-tipped Islamic Centre.

Male Market is another must – just be sure get your haggling skills up to scratch. </p></div>

            <a href="#"><img src="Gallery/maldives/Maafushi1.png"></a>
            <div class="feature-details"><h4>Maafushi</h4><p> Maafushi might not have the sprawling luxury resorts and opulent 5-star hotels that many of its nearby brothers do, but it’s got plenty of charm.

Sadly ravaged in the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, the place has been busy rebuilding its salt-washed fishing jetties and industrious sailor huts in the last decade.

Something that’s helped is the opening up of rights to local guesthouses, which is transforming Maafushi into one of the top off-beat island getaways for budget travelers.

Of course, you can expect gorgeous beaches backed with palms, lapping waves, and a clutch of homey little coffee shops on the shore.  </p></div>

            <div class="feature-details"><h4>Soneva fushi</h4><p>Soneva Fushi is a Robinson Crusoe-style tropical luxury hideaway on an remote island in the Maldives. Each villa is just steps away from white sand beaches and azure sea.

If Robinson Crusoe was a real person, Soneva Fushi would be his dream home. The 65 accommodations in this secluded resort are lofty and spacious and made from the best natural materials. In keeping with the castaway theme, many are built to resemble tree houses. All open to their own private beach and many many boast their own private seawater swimming pools.</p></div>
